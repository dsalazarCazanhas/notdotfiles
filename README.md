I used Kitty as terminal, the configs of it are in .configs/kitty
Configs for a zsh with ohmyzsh shell, are in user_configs with powerlevel10k theme configs. Also
have some plugins defined:
-git
-zsh-syntax-highlighting
-zsh-autosuggestions
-history-substring-search
-docker
-sudo(the plugin is in the misc folder)
Some of the plugins came with zsh others I installed from the AUR

The terminal config uses hackNerdFont, which is in the user_configs folder

For colorfull the terminal
1-fortune(cowfortune)
2-neofetch
3-figlet and toilet
4-lolcat
5-bat
6-lsd
